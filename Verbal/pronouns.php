<br><br>Example: All of the book was destroyed. The verb here refers to the “book” which is singular and hence the pronoun “all” is considered as singular. If the noun is countable then the pronoun is plural else it is singular.
<br>The most common mistake that is usually conducted in these types of questions is to consider a collective noun as plural. Collective nouns like jury, team of players, box of chocolates etc. are singular and also some of the collective nouns that might be ending in ‘s’ as in “Mathematics”. (examples)
<br>Additionally, “which” is used to refer to things, while “who” is used to refer to people. These must not be used otherwise.
<br>One pronoun must refer to one subject only which must be clearly evident without any ambiguity. In case of an ambiguity, the pronoun must be replaced by the noun itself.
