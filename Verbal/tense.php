<br><strong>Verb tense:</strong>
<br>Verbs, words that express action, have three basic forms – past, present and future with each of these having four forms.
<br>
<br><strong>Present tense:</strong>
<br><i>Simple present:</i> He jumps.
<br><i>Present perfect:</i> He has jumped.
<br><i>Present continuous:</i> He is jumping.
<br><i>Present perfect continuous:</i> He has been jumping.
<br><strong>Past tense:</strong>
<br><i>Simple past:</i> He jumped.
<br><i>Past perfect:</i> He had jumped.
<br><i>Past continuous:</i> He was jumping.
<br><i>Past perfect continuous:</i> He had been jumping.

<br><strong>Future tense:</strong>
<br><i>Simple future:</i> He will jump.
<br><i>Future perfect:</i> He will have jumped.
<br><i>Future continuous:</i> He will be jumping.
<br><i>Future perfect continuous:</i> He will have been jumping.
<br>
<br><strong>Verb tense errors:</strong>
<br>Example: Steve had received good cell phone service all month. (Incorrect)
<br>Steve has been receiving good cell phone service all month.
<br>In the above example, past perfect was replaced by present perfect continuous. Such errors are hard to spot due to reduced focus on grammar of the sentences while speaking. Thus, such errors frequently pass under the nose of the candidate. The words “service all month”, suggest the continuing nature of the event in the present and hence present perfect continuous is apt for the sentence.
<br>
<br><strong>Subjunctive tense:</strong>
<br>These are counterfactuals and follow one of the following forms:
<ul>
<li>If clause + were + infinitive form of the verb
Example: If India were to win the World Series, the team’s long suffering fans would rejoice.</li>
<li>If clause + past tense of the verb
Example: If India won the World Series, the team’s long suffering fans would rejoice.</li>
<li>If clause + adjective
Example: If Bruce were rich, Viki would marry him.</li>
<li><int>"</int>command word<int>"</int> + 	that + infinitive verb
Example: The principal required that all students wear appropriate clothing.</li></ul>
