<br>In a simple sentence it is very easy to find out the error, if any of the verbs is incorrectly placed. But, the reason that people make so many mistakes is the presence of prepositional phrases and modifiers in between. There is no limit to the number of prepositional phrases and the number of modifiers in a sentence. The larger the sentence, the more is the number of modifiers and prepositional phrases and harder it is to spot the mistake in the sentence. Sentences with up to three prepositional phrases and three modifiers have been observed in the examination. However, a sentence without a modifier or a prepositional phrase has almost never been recorded in the history of the examination. Given enough time and the fact that one is clear with the rules of grammar, one may be able to find out any number of errors in the sentences. It is the lack of time that plays an important role in getting the questions wrong. Another factor that comes into consideration is the transformation of pen and paper format to an online one. One is unable to mark on the screen thus making it necessary to work with mental markers while solving a problem and testing the skills of an individual to an altogether different level.
<br><br><strong>Subject-verb agreement:</strong>
<br>The basic behind the subject-verb agreement questions is to make sure that singular verbs go with singular subjects while plural verbs go with plural subjects. In a simple sentence, it is easy to make sure that the subject and verb agree with each other and the sentence may not even <int>'</int>sound<int>'</int> right in case it is not so. However, as the modifiers and prepositional phrases are added to the sentences, the subject and the verb move away from each other and since we use simple sentences in our daily conversations, the ‘sound’ of the verb or the agreement depends on the subject closest to it. This subject might not even be the subject that the verb is referring to and hence leads to ambiguity and thus the possibility of making a mistake creeps in. It is important to make sure that the verb in contention is checked with the subject it is referring to, to make sure they agree with each other. (Needs to be peppered with examples)
In case of multiple subjects in a statement that might be separated by and, the subjects are treated as plurals, even when they are singular; while using neither..nor or either..or, the verb must agree with the closest subject. The table below provides a list of indefinite pronouns and their classification as singular or plural.
