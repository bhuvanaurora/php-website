<br>
<br><strong><i>Prepositions</i></strong> are the words like of, for, in, with, at, by, on, from etc. They provide extra information about the subject. Prepositional phrases increase the length of the sentence by providing extra information about the sentence. More than one prepositional phrase can be used in a sentence.
<br>
<br><strong><i>Subordinate clauses</i></strong> start with who, which, when etc. and clauses cannot stand alone as a sentence. These also modify the main subject or the main verb. These are always attached to the main clause and cannot contain main subject or the main verb.
<br>
<br><strong><i>Additive phrases</i></strong> are phrases like as well as, in addition to, accompanied by, together with, including etc. These phrases do not alter the nature of the subjects in the sentence, but provide additional information. However, “and” changes the singular subjects into a compound one.
<br>
<br>With sentences that contain <i>neither..nor</i> or <i>either..or</i>, the verb agrees with the closest noun.
<br>
<br><strong><i>Collective nouns</strong></i> are always treated as singular except for sentences where the emphasis is on the individual entities and not on their unity.
<br>
<br>“Not one” is always singular.
<br>
<br>“Each” and “Every” require a singular verb when preceding the subject.
<br>
<br>Singular possessive nouns ex – Jone’s, Charles’
<br>Plural possessive nouns ex – Children’s, boys’
<br>Nouns that are not possessive – The teachers have claimed, the Joneses did not attend.
<br>Possessive plural pronouns – The problem is hers, the corp must not disclose its assets.
<br>Contractions – It’s time to move on, you’re the one.
<br>
<br>Comma errors
<br>1.	Comma is used to separate two independent clauses joined with a coordinating conjunction.
<br>Coordinating conjunctions (FANBOYS):
<br><strong>F</strong>or
<br><strong>A</strong>nd
<br><strong>N</strong>or
<br><strong>B</strong>ut
<br><strong>O</strong>r
<br><strong>Y</strong>et
<br><strong>S</strong>o
<br>Example: The child agreed, but the parent objected.
<br>
<br>2.	Use a semicolon to separate independent clauses not joined by coordinating conjunction.
<br>Example: The child agreed; however the parent objected.
<br>Comma may be eliminated in balanced or brief independent clauses.
<br>Example: Ulysses has a great jump shot, but he isn’t quick on his feet.
<br>Ulysses has a great jump shot but he isn’t quick on his feet. (Both correct)
<br>Yours is timely and mine is late. (No comma required in this case)
<br>
<br>3.	Conjunctive adverbs signal the relationship between point(s) made in the material before and after the sentence. Following is the list of conjunctive adverbs:
<br>Accordingly		However		Nonetheless			Besides
<br>Indeed		Otherwise		Also				Instead
<br>Similarly		Consequently	Likewise			Still
<br>Conversely		Meanwhile		Subsequently		Finally
<br>Moreover		Then			Furthermore			Nevertheless
<br>Therefore		Hence			Next				Thus
<br>While beginning a conjunctive adverb or using it in the middle of a sentence, it should be set off with a comma.
<br>Example: The student, moreover, has not yet turned in an acceptable project to meet his assignment’s requirements.
<br>
<br>4.	Commas are used to set off the year if the day is also identified or else is omitted.
<br>Example: The birth of Norma on June 2, 1974, brought me…
<br>The birth of Norma in June 1974 brought me…
<br>
<br>5.	Commas are used to separate three or more items in a list. If the descriptions of the items are long or complex, semicolons are used to separate them.
<br>Gerund or gerund phrases, “ing” verbs that serve as noun, take possessive pronouns. Example: We’ll go to their home for the party instead of their coming to ours. Coming to work late can result in disciplinary action.
<br>
<br><ul>Mass nouns: Do not take any plural form.
<li>	advice, air, blood, equipment, food, garbage, graffiti</li>
<li>	grass, homework, housework, information, knowledge, luggage</li>
<li>	mathematics, meat, milk, money, music, pollution</li>
<li>	research, sand, soap, software, sugar, time, traffic</li>
<li>	transportation, travel, trash, water</li></ul>
<br>Exceptions: Some nouns permit treatment as either countable or uncountable nouns like salad as in “a lot of salad” or “many salads”.
<br>Some nouns that are always singular: gold, silver, wheat, corn and sugar.
<br>Some nouns that are always plural: trousers, scissors, shears, measles and cattle.
<br>Examples: He worked harder than I. The person least anxious after the test was she.
<br>
<br>Common pitfalls: Ms. Thomson wanted to try and finish the project by Friday.
<br>Be sure and pick up the baby from the daycare.
<br>In the above sentences “and” is to be replaced by “to” to maintain the parallelism of structure.
<br>“Hopefully” is an adverb. So the sentence: “Hopefully the storm will pass”, means that the storm’s passing will be full of hope. I hope the storm will pass or she asked hopefully are correct sentences.
<br>“Myself” is a reflective pronoun as in, I will draft the answers myself. Ms. Alpha and myself will meet you for lunch would be an incorrect statement. Replacing the word “myself” with I or me in such sentences would help make better sense of such sentences.
<br>A comma is to be used before “which” but not “that”. Example: Please go to that room and get me the big book, which is mine. Please go to that room and get me the big book that is mine.
<br>Costs to X: What X has to pay.
<br>Cost of X: What someone has to pay to buy X.
<br>Raise is a verb that takes direct object. Example: The Fed raised the interest rate.
<br>Rise does not take a direct verb. Example: The interest rate rose in March.
<br>
<br>•	Farther is used only for distance.
<br>She is the most dedicated gardener on the block, every day watering the more than 50 plants in her yard.
<br>•	“Such as” is used to introduce examples, whereas “like” is used to make a comparison.
<br>The students are encouraged to pursue extracurricular activities like student government, sports and the arts. “Like” in the statement means similar to but not necessarily including. We choose ‘such as’ instead in this case.
<br>•	Sal applied himself in his new job, arriving early every day, skipping lunch regularly and leaving late every night. The main clause in the sentence, applied himself to the new job, is not parallel to these participle phrases. This is correct.
<br>Examples:
<br>The scientist believes that the machine will be wonderful.
<br>The scientist believed that the machine would be wonderful. “Would be” suggests the conditional nature of the belief held in the past.
<br>If Sophie eats burger tomorrow, then she will become ill. The statement refers to a particular case in the future with no uncertainty.
<br>If Sophie ate burger tomorrow, then she would become ill. The statement refers to an unlikely case in the future.
<br>If Sophie had eaten burger yesterday, then she would have become ill. The statement refers to a case that never happened in the past.
