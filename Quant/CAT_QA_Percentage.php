<p>The word percent means per hundred. &#8220;Percent&#8221; comes from Latin <em>Per Centum</em>. The Latin word <em>Centum</em> means 100, as in a Century which is 100 years.</p>
<p>Using Percent:<br />
Because &#8220;Percent&#8221; means &#8220;per 100&#8243;: &#8220;this should be divided by 100&#8243;<br />
So <strong>55%</strong> really means <sup>55</sup>/<sub>100</sub></p>
<p>Practical Examples:<br />
100% of <strong>60</strong> is <strong><sup>100</sup></strong>/<strong><sub>100</sub></strong> <int>*</int> 60 = 60<br />
50% of <strong>60</strong> is <strong><sup>50</sup></strong>/<strong><sub>100</sub></strong> <int>*</int> 60 = 30<br />
5% of <strong>60</strong> is <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>/<strong><sub>100</sub></strong> <int>*</int> 60 = 3</p>
<p><strong><em>Percentages, Fractions and Ratios:</em></strong><br />
To convert a fraction into percentage, simply multiply the fraction by 100 and put the <int>"</int>%<int>"</int> sign.<br />
Example: 1/2 can be written as 1/2 x 100 = 50%.
<p>To convert a percentage into a fraction, use the reverse technique: divide the fraction by 100 and remove the <int>"</int>%<int>"</int> sign.<br />
Example: 75% can be written as 75/100 = 3/4</p>
<p>To convert a percentage into a ratio, first convert the percentage into a fraction, and then the fraction into a ratio.</p>
<p>Example: Convert 25% into a ratio.<br />
25% = 25/100 =1/4 = 1 : 4</p>
(Questions)<br />
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Mr. Murthy spends 37.50% of salary, which is Rs. 24000, on the tuition expense of his child.  What is the amount left with him after paying for his child’s fee?<br />
Solution: The question can be solved easily using the values given in the table above.<br />
37.5% percent means 3/8, therefore Mr. Murthy spend 3/8 X 24000 on his child’s fee, which amounts to 9000. The balance amount with him is 15000.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> A piece of furniture, priced Rs. 8000 back then, costs 25% more now. What is its current price?<br />
Solution: We know that its current price is 25% more, that is ¼ of 8000 = 2000.<br />
Thus, its current price is Rs. 10000.</p>
<p>A simple shortcut reduces the amount of calculation you need to do.</p>
<p><strong><em>The uses of percentage:</em></strong><br />(Use questions instead to explain the uses of percentage rather than description) <br />
Percentages are extremely handy mathematical devices that can be used for a variety of purposes. They can brought to a number of uses and these uses form part of the applications of the concept.</p>
<p><strong>Use 1: For comparisons</strong><br />
Kindly go through the following information:<br />
1. Kamal, who lives in US, scored 500 marks in his grade 6 examination.<br />
2. Rahul, who lives in China, scored 300 marks in his grade 6 examination.<br />
3. Manish, who lives in China, scored 600 marks in his grade 6 examination.<br />
This means Manish is the best student from the above lot.</p>
<p>Well, this is a faulty conclusion. For actual comparison, we need the bases and percentage marks for each of the students.<br />
1. Kamal, who lives in US, scored 500 marks out of a total of 800 in his grade 6 examination; thereby securing 62.5% marks.<br />
2. Rahul, who lives in China, scored 300 marks out of a total of 400 in his grade 6 examination; thereby securing 75% marks.<br />
3. Manish, who lives in China, scored 600 marks out of a total of 1000 in his grade 6 examination; thereby securing 60% marks.</p>
<p>Well, now we have the full picture, and can clearly see that Rahul is the best out of the lot (though we have made a critical reasoning assumption here: the nature of the examinations was same and can be compared; well, while studying maths, we can leave out the reasoning bit).</p>
<p><strong>Use 2: For measurements such as constitution of something, or rate of change of some feature/property etc.</strong><br />
The basic functions of percentage is to tell us the constitution of things and the rate of change of things. For examples, percentages come in extremely handy in the following types of situations:</p>
<p><strong>Example 3:</strong> Atish had a salary of Rs. 8000 per month when he joined Wordpandit. His salary increased to Rs. 12000 the following year. What is the percentage hike in the salary of Atish in comparison to his previous year’s salary?<br />
Solution: Hike in salary: {(12000-8000)/8000}* 100 ={4000/8000}*100 =50%</p>
<p><strong>Example 4:</strong> Substance A contains 20% of abc, abc contains 10% of def, def contains 5% of ghi. What is the percentage of ghi in A?<br />
Solution: We can solve this question in a series of steps.<br />
Let us assume A = 100 units<br />
This means abc in A = 20 units<br />
def in abc (which is in A) = 2 units<br />
ghi in def (which is abc, which in turn is in ABC) = 0.1 (this represents the amount of def in A as well)<br />
% of def in A = (0.1/100) * 100 = 0.1 %</p>
<p>The above illustrates some uses of percentages. The second example above is actually a usage of successive percentage changes. What is this? Let’s study it in the next bit of this article.</p>
<p><strong>Percentage Tooltip-1:  Successive percentage changes</strong><br />
Suppose we increase a quantity by 10% at first, and then the increased quantity by 10% again. What is the net increase? 20%. Nopes, not 20%.</p>
<p>Have a close look:<br />
Assume the quantity weighed 100 units.<br />
We increased it by 10%, that is 10 units. Total= 110 units.<br />
Then we increased the increased total by 10%, that is 110 by 10% = 11 units<br />
Total quantity: 121 units<br />
Net percentage increase: 21% and not 20%.</p>
<p>This is the concept of successive percentage changes and the basic thing that needs to be kept in mind is that the base changes every time. So you need to keep the revised base in mind.</p>
<p><em>Formula for revised percentage change:</em><br />
Suppose a number N undergoes a percentage change of x % and then y%, the net change is:<br />
New number = N * (1 + x/100) * (1 + y/100)<br />
Now, (1 + x/100) * (1 + y/100) = 1 + x/100 + y/100 + xy/10000<br />
If we say that <strong><em>x + y + xy/100 = z</em></strong>, then (1 + x/100) * (1 + y/100) = 1 + z/100<br />
Here,<strong><em> z is the effective percentage change</em></strong> when a number is changed successively by two percentage changes.</p>
<p><em>Formulas and extensions of the above:</em><br />
x and y are positive and imply increase = (x+y+xy/100) %.<br />
x is positive and y is negative = (x-y-xy/100)%<br />
x and y both are negative and imply a clear decrease= (-x-y+xy/100)%</p>
<p>Let us use the above in some questions:</p>
<p><strong>Example 5:</strong> A city’s population was 100000 at the end of 2010. In 2011, it increased by 10% and in 2012, it decreased by 18.18%. What was the city’s population at the end of 2012?<br />
Solution:<br />
Population at the end of 2010 = 100000<br />
Population at the end of 2011 = 100000 * (11/10) = 110000<br />
Population at the end of 2010 = 110000 * (9/11) = 90000<br />
Simply put, population at the end of 2010 = 100000 * (11/10) * (9/11) = 90000</p>
<p>Or if we use our formula for successive percentage change:<br />
Change = 10-18.18- (10*18.18/100)= -9.998 (approx -10%)<br />
(the difference above is cause by using exact values).<br />
Hence, net population = 90000</p>
<p><strong>Example 6:</strong> Six months back, the cost of an air ticket from Delhi to Bombay was Rs. Four months back, the fares increased by 12.5%. Last month, the fares increased by 25% and yesterday, the airlines again increased the fares by 11.11%. What is the price of a Delhi to Bomaby ticket today?<br />
Solution:<br />
Price of a ticket today = 4000 * (9/8) * (5/4) * (10/9) =  Rs. 6250<br />
This is much faster than finding the ticket price at every price change which would need the following steps:<br />
Price of a ticket four months back = 4000 * (9/8) = Rs. 4500<br />
Price of a ticket last month back = 4500 * (5/4) = Rs. 5625<br />
and finally, price of a ticket today = 5625 * (10/9) = Rs. 6250</p>
<p><strong>Percentage Tooltip-2: Concept Of &#8216;By&#8217; And &#8216;To&#8217;</strong><br />
One little tooltip that you need to keep in mind is the difference between “by” and “to”. These two prepositions can make a hell of difference when it comes to the meaning of an intended statement in a question. Refer to these statements:</p>
<p>Atish’s income reduced by 20%, that means the new income is 80% of the original value.<br />
Atish’s income is reduced to 20% means that his new income is 20% of the original value. Now we can see how big a difference is this.<br />
“By” effectively represents the difference and “to” represents the final value.</p>
<p><strong>Percentage Tooltip-3: Percentage Change</strong>:<br />
Percent increase and percent decrease are measures of percent change and it is defined as the percentage increase or percentage decrease.  A simple formula for it is:<br />
Percentage change (%) = (Final value – Initial value) / Initial value x 100</p>
<p>Let’s take an <strong>Example</strong> to understand it</p>
<p><strong>Example 7:</strong> Richa’s salary in the month of April was Rs.2000 and now her salary increased to Rs. 2500. Then find the percentage change in Richa’s salary   ?<br />
Solution: Since the percentage change is the decrease or increase, so the percentage change in the Richa’s salary can be calculated by a formula i.e.<br />
Percentage change (%) = (Final value – Initial value) / Initial value x 100<br />
So in case of Richa’s salary final value is 2500 and initial value is 2000 so<br />
ð  (2500 -2000) / 2000 x 100 = 25%<br />
So there is 25% increase in the Richa’s salary</p>
<p><strong>Percentage Tooltip-4: Percentage point change</strong><br />
Percentage point change is the difference between two percentage values. Let’s take an example to understand it.</p>
<p><strong>Example 8:</strong> Increment in the salaries of A and B for the month of  May are 25% and 45% ,then find the percentage point change in salaries of A and B?<br />
Solution: Percentage point change is the difference between two percentage values so we have the percentage increase in A’s salary i.e. 25 % and the percentage change in the B’s salary is 45% so the<br />
% point change = 45-25<br />
= 25 percentage point</p>
<p>Always remember a percent change may be negative which is known as percentage decrease but a percentage point change can’t be negative it is always positive</p>
<p><strong>Percentage Tooltip-5: Product Constancy (Application of Percentages)</strong><br />
In this topic, we use the concept of relationships between difference quantities. For example, understand the relationship given below:</p>
<p>Number of persons x No of Working Days x No of Working hours per day = Word Done in man hours<br />
Or<br />
Number of persons x No of Working Days = Word Done in man days</p>
<p>Now if we vary the variables on the left hand side, we can maintain the same value on the right hand side.  Say, for example, we increase the number of persons doing a work by 25%, then we need to reduce the number of working days by 20% to maintain the same output of work. This concept is applicable in a number of topics such as time, speed and distance, average and ratio and even area measurements.</p>
<p><strong>Example 9: </strong>The price of Wheat has increased by 37%, then by what percent should a customer reduce his consumption of Wheat so that his expense does not change?<br />
Solution: Here we will understand the problem step by step <strong></strong><br />
1. Price x Quantity = Expenditure<br />
2. Let us take some hypothetical values of the above quantities.<br />
Rs. 100 is the price of wheat and originally, the customer planned to buy 100 kg.<br />
Original expenditure: Rs. 10000<br />
3. The price has increased by 37%, so current price = Rs. 137<br />
In order to maintain the same expense, we get the equation:<br />
137 x Q = 10000<br />
Q = 10000/137 = 72.99<br />
Here we can see that the customer purchased 100kg initially and this has dropped to 72.99kg now. This means % decrease is 27.01%</p>
<p><strong>Percentage Tooltip-6: Difference between Increased value and Increase in value </strong><br />
Let’s take one example to understand the difference between these two terms, increased value and increase in value.<br />
If initial value is 100 and the final value 200 then in this case:<br />
<em>The Increased value is 200 </em><br />
<em>The Increase in value is 100</em><br />
<em>And increased percentage is (200 -100)/100 x 100 = 100%</em></p>
<p>Similarly this is also applicable to decrease in value, decreased value, and percentage decrease<br />
Some points to remember: If there is a increase of x/y in any percentage value (V) then<br />
Increased value becomes   V (1+x/y)<br />
If there is a decrease of x/y in any percentage value (V) then<br />
Decreased value becomes   V (1-x/y)</p>
<p><strong>Example 10: </strong>Sona is now 25 years old. After some years, her age will increase by 33.33% of her. What will be the new age of her at that time? <strong></strong><br />
Solution: Here if we see there is increase of 33.33% i.e.1/3 of her age. So the increased value of age will be at that time = 25 (1+1/3) = 33<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> years.</p>
