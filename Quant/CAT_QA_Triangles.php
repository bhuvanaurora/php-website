    • In a triangle ABC, sum of 2 sides must be greater than the 3rd side.
    • In triangle ABC, AD is perpendicular to BC, if AD^2 = BD*CD, the triangle is: right angled
    • If the perpendicular drawn from the vertex of a right angled triangle to the hypotenuse, the number of similar triangles formed is equal to: 3
    • The ratios of areas of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of: squares on the corresponding sides
    • Angle Bisector Theorem:
        ○ If AD is the angle bisector for angle A, then: AB / BD = AC / CD 
        ○ In any triangle the angular bisector of an angle bisects the base in the ratio of the other two sides. 
    • In a triangle ABC, the median AD bisecting the side BC has its midpoint O; the line CO meets AB at E. AE= AB/3
    • A triangle can have at most one : obtuse angle
    • PERPENDICULAR BISECTOR of a line:
        ○ All points on the perpendicular bisector of a line are equidistant from the endpoints of the line.
    • Angle Bisector:
        ○ All points on the angle bisector are equidistant from the sides forming the angle 
    • Congruency of triangles:
        ○ S-S-S
        ○ S-A-S
        ○ A-A-S
    • Similarity of triangles:
        ○ A-A rule
        ○ S-S-S rule
    • 4 Important Points:
        ○ CENTROID: concurrency point of medians
            § The median divides the triangle in two parts of equal areas (but need not be congruent)
            § The centroid divides the median in the ratio 2:1 with the larger part towards the vertex
            § The sum of 2 medians of triangle is: greater than the third
        ○ IN-CENTRE: concurrency point of angle bisectors
        ○ CIRCUM-CENTER: concurrency point of perpendicular bisectors
        ○ ORTHO-CENTRE: concurrency point of altitudes 
    • In an isosceles triangle ABC; D, E, Fare the midpoints of the base BC and the equal sides AB, AC resp, then: DF=DE
    • The median on the hypotenuse of a right angled triangle is equal to : nothing can be said
    • The straight line drawn from the midpoint of a side of a triangle, parallel to the base is one that: bisects the other side
    • The bisector of the exterior angle at the vertex of an isosceles triangle is: parallel to the base
    • The angle between the internal bisector of one base angle and the exterior bisector of the other base angle is equal to : one half the vertical angle
    • In a triangle ABC, if the median/altitude BE is equal to the median/altitude CF, then the triangle is : isosceles
    • If the bisector of any angle of a triangle bisects its opposite side, the triangle is: isosceles
    • The straight line joining the midpoints of any 2 sides of a triangle is: parallel to the third side
    • If 2 angles of a triangle are congruent, the sides opposite of these angles are: congruent
    • The bisectors of the angle at the vertex of an isosceles triangle: bisects the base and is perpendicular to it
    • If the bisectors of 2 adjacent angles are perpendicular, the adjacent angles are the angles of : linear pair
    • When the bisector of any angle is perpendicular to the opposite side, then the triangle is : equilateral
    • 2 sides of a triangle are unequal,  the angle just opposite to the larger side is : greater than the angle opposite the smaller side
    • One angle of a triangle is greater than the other, the side opposite to it is: greater than the side opposite to the other
    • In a triangle, the sum of the 2 angles is equal to the third angle, considering interior angles only, then the triangle is : right angled
    • In a triangle, interior opposite angle is always less than : the exterior angle
    • In an isosceles triangle, the perpendicular from the vertex to the base or the angular bisector from vertex to base bisects the base.
    • APPOLLONIUS THEOREM: 
        ○ In a triangle, if AD be the median to the side BC, then AB^2 + AC^2 = 2(AD^2 + BD^2) or 2(AD^2 + DC^2) 
        ○ It can be applied to the 4 triangles of a parallelogram

    • Area of a triangle  
        ○ 1/2 base.altitude  
        ○ 1/2 a.b.sinC = 1/2 b.c.sinA = 1/2 c.a.sinB  
        ○ root(s.(s-a).(s-b).(s-c))
        ○ (a.b.c/4R) =r.s where s=a+b+c/2 ; R is the CIRCUMRADIUS of the triangle; r is the inradius of the triangle  
    • In any triangle: a/sinA = b/sinB = c/sinC = 2R , where R is the Circumradius 
    • In any triangle: a=b*cosC + c*cosB; b=c*cosA + a*cosC; c=a*cosB + b*cosA
    
EQUILATERAL TRIANGLE:-
    • Let a be the side of an equilateral triangle. then if three circles be drawn inside this triangle touching each other, then each radius = 
    
    • The ratio of the radii of the circumcircle and incircle of an equilateral triangle is 2:1 . For an eq. triangle of side 'a':
        ○ Inradius (r) = a/(2*3^0.5)
        ○ Circumradius (R) = a/(3^0.5)
    • An equilateral triangle inside the incircle of a bigger equilateral triangle would be 1/4 in area and 1/2 in side length compared to the bigger triangle.
    • If similar figures are drawn recursively, the ratio of sides and areas remain constant.
        ○ If we draw a circle inside an equilateral triangle and then a circle inside the triangle and so on:
            § Each triangle/circle has 1/4 of the area of the preceding triangle/circle.
