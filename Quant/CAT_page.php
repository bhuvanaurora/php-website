                <div class="hr"><hr /></div> 
                    <p> CAT is a computer based standarized test jointly conducted by the IIMs. Indian Business Schools use this test as a criterion for admission to its business administration programs. Prior to 2009, the exam used to be a paper and pencil test.
                    </br>
                    The exam pattern consists of two sections:-
                    <ol>    
                        <li> Quantitative Ability & Data Interpretation (QA & DI) </li>
                        <li> Verbal Ability & Logical Reasoning (VA & LR) </li>
                    </ol>
                    </p>
                    
                     <h4 id="section2"> DURATION</h4>
                     <p>
                     The first section which will appear on your screen will be QA & DI followed by VA & LR. These two sections will be implemented sequentially with separate time limits. </br>

                    The examination will be for 140 minutes. Candidates will have 70 minutes to answer 30 questions within each section which will have an on-screen countdown timer. Once the time ends for the first section, they will move to the second section and will no longer be able to go back. </br>

                    A 15-minute tutorial will be provided before the start of the test, and candidates are advised to go through that carefully before starting the main examination. The total duration will be two hours and 35 minutes including the tutorial. 
                    </p>
               
                    <h4 id="section3">ELIGIBILITY</h4>
                        <p> The candidate must hold a Bachelorâ€™s Degree, with at least 50 per cent marks or equivalent CGPA [45 per cent in case of the candidates belonging to Scheduled Caste (SC), Scheduled Tribe (ST) and Differently Abled (DA) categories.
