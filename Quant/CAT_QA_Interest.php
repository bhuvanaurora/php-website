Interest is defined as the "time value of money" which means that the value of money changes with time. Suppose you have Rs. 100 in the year 2010. 
In business terms if you invest the money in a bank that pays 5<int>%</int> interest, the amount would have grown to Rs. 105 in 2011
(because now the money you have is Rs. 100 that you had initially plus 5% that bank paid for depositing).</p>
<p>The sum of money borrowed or invested is called as the principal amount and the additional amount paid back over and above the borrowed the sum 
is called the interest which is in time-dependent percentage terms.</p>
<p>Simple Interest (SI) =  (P x R x T)/100</p>
<p>Where:<br />
<strong>P</strong>: Principal (original amount)<br />
<strong>R</strong>: Rate of Interest (in %)<br />
<strong>T</strong>: Time period (yearly, half-yearly etc.)</p>
<p>Amount due at the end of the time period, A = P + SI<br />
A = P + (P x R x T)/100 </p>
(Questions) <br />
(Use video for explanation of concept) <br />
<p><em>Basic Problem 1: What is the SI on Rs. 7500/- at the rate of 12% per annum for 8 years?</em><br />
Using the Basic Formula:<br />
Simple Interest (SI) =  (P x R x T)/100<br />
P – Principal amount, T- Number of years, R – Rate of Interest<br />
Given P = 7500, N = 8 Years, R = 12%<br />
S.I = (7500X12X8)/100<br />
S.I = 7200</p>
<p><em>Basic Problem 2: A man borrowed rs.15000/- at the rate of 24% SI and to clear the debt after 6 years, much he has to return:</em><br />
Using the Basic Formula:<br />
Simple Interest (SI) =  (P x R x T)/100<br />
P – Principal amount, T- Number of years, R – Rate of Interest<br />
Given P = 15000, T = 6 Years, R = 8%<br />
S.I = PNR / 100<br />
S.I =(15000X24X6)/100<br />
= 21600<br />
Therefore, total interest = 21600<br />
Total repayment = S.I + Principal amount<br />
Answer = 21600 + 15000 = Rs 36600</p>
<p><em>Basic Problem 3: A man borrowed Rs.12000 at the rate of 10% SI, and lent the same sum to another person at the rate of 15% what will be the gain after 5 years?</em><br />
Using the Basic Formula:<br />
Simple Interest (SI) =  (P x R x T)/100<br />
P – Principal amount, T- Number of years, R – Rate of Interest<br />
A man borrowed at 15%<br />
He lent the same sum to another person at 15%<br />
Therefore his gain is actually equal to the different in the interest rate (per year) 15 – 10 =5% for 1 year<br />
Thus, to calculate his gain, we use this difference as the rate of interest.<br />
Given T = 5 years and P = Rs. 12000<br />
First we are calculating for Rs. 100<br />
Amount Gained = (12000x5x5)/100 = Rs. 3000<br />
Therefore his gain = Rs. 3000/-</p>
<p><strong><em>Simple Interest Tooltip 4: Understanding Simple Interest Through Solved Multiple Choice Examples</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Example 1: A sum of money at simple interest amounts to Rs. 850 in 3 years and to Rs. 900 in 4 years. The sum is:</strong></p>
<p>A.Rs. 650                              B.Rs. 690                              C.Rs. 698                              D.Rs. 700</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Option <strong>D</strong><br />
<strong>Explanation:</strong><br />
S.I. for 1 year = Rs. (900 &#8211; 850) = Rs. 50<br />
S.I. for 3 years = Rs.(39 x 3) = Rs. 150<br />
Original Amount/ Principal = Rs. (850 &#8211; 150) = Rs. 700</p>
<p><strong>Example 2: Maninder invested into two different schemes, P and Q at simple interest rate of invested an amount of Rs. 15,000. Rate of interest for scheme P &amp; Q were 14% p.a. and 18% p.a. respectively. If the total amount of simple interest earned in 2 years be Rs. 5000, what was the amount invested in Scheme P?</strong></p>
<p>A.Rs. 5000                           B.Rs. 6500                            C.Rs. 7200                            D.Rs. 7500</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Option <strong>A</strong><br />
<strong>Explanation:</strong><br />
Let the sum invested in Scheme P be Rs. <em>x </em>and that in Scheme Q be Rs. (15000 &#8211; <em>x</em>).<br />
Then,<br />
<em>{x </em>x 14 x 2}/100 + {(15000 &#8211; <em>x</em>) x 18 x 2}/100 = 5000<br />
28x+540000-36x=500000<br />
8x=40000<br />
x=5000<br />
Hence, money deposited in scheme x = 5000.</p>
<p><strong>Example 3:  A sum of Rs. 15,000 amounts to Rs. 19,500 in 5 years at the rate of simple interest. What is the rate of interest?</strong></p>
<p>A.3%                                      B.4%                                      C.5%                                      D.6%</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br />
S.I. = Rs. (19500 &#8211; 15000) = Rs. 4500.<br />
We know:<br />
Simple Interest (SI) =  (P x R x T)/100<br />
P – Principal amount, T- Number of years, R – Rate of Interest<br />
Therefore,<br />
4500 = (15000xRx5)/100<br />
R = 6%</p>
<p><strong>Example 4:  How much time will it take for an amount of Rs. 900 to yield Rs. 81 as interest at 2.25% per annum of simple interest?</strong></p>
<p>A. 3 years                            B. 4 years                             C. 5 years                             D.6 years</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br />
We know:<br />
Simple Interest (SI) =  (P x R x T)/100<br />
P – Principal amount, T- Number of years, R – Rate of Interest<br />
Therefore:<br />
81 = (900&#215;2.25xT)/100<br />
T = 4 years</p>
<p><strong>Example 5: A money-lender claims he lends money at simple rate of interest of 10% per annum. But he cleverly tricks the farmers by including the interest amount in the principal when he calculates it every six months. The effective annual rate of interest he is charging is:</strong></p>
<p>A.10%                                   B.10.25%                             C.10.5%                                D. 10.75%</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Let the sum be Rs. 100. Then,<br />
S.I. for first six months = Rs. (100 x 10 x 1)/(100&#215;2)<br />
= Rs. 5<br />
Increase principal for the last six months= Rs. 105<br />
SI for the last six months = Rs. (105 x 10 x 1)/ (100&#215;2)<br />
SI = Rs. 5.25<br />
Net interest charged in an year = Rs. 10.25<br />
Hence, effective rate of interest = (10.25/100) x 100 = 10.25%.</p>
</p>


<p>
Having done with simple interest, it is time to be introduced to another type of interest called compound interes. 
In simple interest the interest is calculated over the principal amount and the interest keeps piling on.
However, in compound interest, you gain interest on the interest amount as well that has been piling on thus increasing returns.</p>
<p>For example, Sunil borrows a sum of Rs. 100 from Ghansham for a period of two years. The rate of interest for this loan is 10%. At the end of year one, the amount due is the principal and 10% interest on it, that is a total of Rs. 110. Now, effectively the principal value of the loan for the second year is no longer Rs. 100, it is in fact Rs. 110. That is what Ghansham would say and believe. According to him, for the 2<sup>nd</sup> year, he has lent Rs. 110 as that was the amount he would have had if he taken back the money at the end of year 1. Now for the 2<sup>nd</sup> year, the interest becomes Rs. 11 (10% of Rs. 110) and the total amount Ghansham would get would be Rs. 121.</p>
<p>If the same calculation was done using the logic of simple interest, you would see that the interest due for two years would be Rs. 20 (10% of Rs. 100 for two years). Thus, replace a S with a C and there is such a big difference in the calculations carried out.</p>
<p>Effectively, for compound interest, the 2<sup>nd</sup> term of interest is the sum total of the principal and the interest for the first term.
<p>Amount Due at the end of the time period, A =  P (1+r/100)<sup>t</sup></p>
<p>Where:<br />
<strong>P</strong>: Principal (original amount)<br />
<strong>R</strong>: Rate of Interest (in %)<br />
<strong>T</strong>: Time period (yearly, half-yearly etc.)</p>
<p>Compound Interest (CI) =  A- P = P (1+r/100)<sup>t</sup> -P<br />
= P [(1+r/100)<sup>t</sup> -1]</p>
(Questions) <br />
<p><strong>Example 1: </strong>Maninder took a loan of Rs. 10000 from Prashant . If the rate of interest is 5% per annum compounded annually, find the amount received by Prashant by the end of three years</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>:<br />
The following is the data given:<br />
Principal, P= 10000<br />
Rate = 5%<br />
Time =3 years</p>
<p>Using the formula for Compound Interest:<br />
<strong>A = P(1+R/100)<sup>t</sup></strong><br />
<strong>So A= </strong>10000(1+5/100)<sup>3</sup><br />
A = 10000(1+1/20)<sup>3</sup><br />
A = 10000 x 21/20 x 21/20 x21/20 =11576.25<br />
So the total amount paid by Maninder at the end of third year is Rs.11576.25</p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong>: Richa gave Rs. 8100 to Bharat at a rate of 9% for 2 years compounded annually. Find the amount of money which she gained as a compound interest from Bharat at the end of second year.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>:<br />
Principal value = 8100<br />
Rate = 9%<br />
Time = 2 years<br />
So the total amount paid by Bharat<br />
= 8100(1+9/100)<sup>2</sup><br />
=Rs.  9623.61</p>
<p>The question does not probe the amount, rather, it wants to know the CI paid, that the difference between the total amount and original principal.<br />
The Compound Interest = 9623.61 – 8100 = 1523.61</p>
<p><strong>Compound Interest Tooltip 4: Multiple Compounding in a year </strong></p>
<p>Amount Due at the end of the time period</p>
A = P (1 + r/n)<sup>nt</sup>
Where:<br />
A = future value<br />
P = principal amount (initial investment)<br />
r = annual nominal interest rate<br />
n = number of times the interest is compounded per year<br />
t = number of years money borrowed</p>
<p><strong>Amount for Half Yearly Compounding, A = P {1+(R/2)/ 100}<sup>2T</sup> </strong><br />
(compound interest applied two times an year).</p>
<p><strong>Like Half Yearly Compound Interest, we can calculate the amount for Quarterly Compounding:</strong></p>
<p><strong>A = P {1+(R/4)/ 100}<sup>4T</sup></strong></p>
<p><strong>Example 3:</strong> Sona deposited Rs. 4000 in a bank for 2 years at 5% rate. Find the amount received at the end of year by her from the bank when compounded half yearly.</p>
<p>Solution:<br />
Principal value = Rs. 4000<br />
Rate = 5%<br />
Time = 2 years<br />
Since the interest is compounded half yearly so 2 years = 4 times in two years<br />
So we have =<strong> A = P {1+(R/2)/ 100}<sup>2T</sup></strong><br />
A= 4000{1+ (5/2)/100}<sup>4</sup><br />
A = 4000 x 41/40 x 41/40 x 41/40 x 41/40<br />
A = Rs. 4415.2<br />
So, Sona received Rs. 4415.2 from the bank after two years</p>
<p><strong>Example 4:</strong> Manpreet lent Rs 5000 to Richa at 10% rate for 1 year. But she told her that she will take her money on compound interest. So find the amount of interest received by Manpreet when compounded quarterly?</p>
<p>Solution:<br />
Principal value = Rs. 5000<br />
Rate = 10%<br />
Time = 1 year<br />
Since the interest is compounded quarterly, that is 4 times in 1 year<br />
Using the formula=<strong> A = P {1+(R/4)/ 100}<sup>4T</sup></strong><br />
A= 5000{1+ (10/4)/100}<sup>4</sup><br />
A = 5000 x 41/40 x 41/40 x 41/40 x 41/40<br />
A = Rs. 5519.064<br />
So, Manpreet received Rs. 4415.2 from bank after two years<br />
And the total amount of interest received by her is 5519.064 – 5000 = Rs. 519.06</p>
<p><strong>Example 5:</strong><br />
<strong>The difference between compound interest and simple interest is 2500 for two years at 2% rate, then find the original sum.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution: </strong><br />
Given Interest is = 2500<br />
So, Simple Interest = (P X R X T)/100<br />
Compound Interest = P [(1+r/100)<sup>t</sup> – 1]<br />
So the difference between both of them is<br />
= PRT/100 – P [(1+R/100)<sup>T</sup> -1]<br />
= P [(1+r/100)<sup>T</sup> -1-RT/100]<br />
So the sum is 2500 = P [{(1+2/100)<sup>2</sup>-1}-4/100]<br />
On simplification this equation the sum will be = Rs. 6250000</p>
<p><strong>We can check it by our shortcut method</strong><br />
When time given is 2 years = P(R/100)<sup>2 </sup><br />
Since we are given by the difference so<br />
2500 = P (2/100)<sup>2</sup><br />
=&gt; 2500 = P (1/50)<sup>2</sup><br />
=&gt; 2500= P (1/2500)<br />
=&gt; 6250000=P</p>
<p>So the sum is Rs.6250000.</p>
<p>Similarly we can conclude the sum when time given is 3 years.</p>
<p><strong>Compound interest when compounding in a year but time is in fraction</strong></p>
<p>The formula to calculate compound interest when the time given is in fractions is as follows:<br />
A =P[(1+R/100)<sup>real part</sup>{1+(Fraction part x R/100)}]</p>
<p>Where<br />
A: Amount at the end of the time period<br />
P: Principal amount<br />
R: Rate of interest<br />
Real Part and Fraction part: For example, the time given is two and half years, then real part would be two and half years.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1: </strong><br />
<strong>Manpreet gave Rs. 1000 to Richa for 1 year 6 months. Then find the amount paid by Richa to Manpreet after this duration if rate of interest is 5% per annum compounded annually?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution :</strong><br />
We have a time of 1 years and 6 months = (1 year + 1/2 years)<br />
So to find the amount we will use<br />
A =P[(1+R/100)<sup>real part</sup>{1+(Fraction part x R/100)}]<br />
A = 1000[(1+5/100)<sup>1</sup>{1+{(6/12 x 5)/100]<br />
A= P[(21/20) x (41/40)]<br />
A = Rs. 1076.25
<p><strong>Equal Installments</strong></p>
Well, say, a certain sum of money is borrowed on compound interest for a certain period and it is returned with the help of equal installments.</p>
<p>Let us derive a formula where the amount is returned in two equal installments for a time period of two years.</p>
<p>Let P be the principal and r the rate of interest.</p>
<p>Step 1: P(1+r/100)=P1  (Amount for one year)<br />
Step 2: New Principal<br />
Now let X be the first installment. After giving the first installment, the principal value will change and the new principal will be = P1 <int>-</int> X<br />
P2 = P1 <int>-</int> X (1+R/100)<br />
Step 3: Amount and Interest for the second year<br />
Now the interest charged will be charged on this amount.<br />
Amount at the end of second year: [P(1+r/100)-X][1+r/100]<br />
Step 4: Since the installments are equal, this new amount has to equal X.<br />
Hence,<br />
[P(1+r/100)-X][1+r/100]=X<br />
On solving, we have<br />
P [(1+R/100)<sup>2</sup>-X (1+R/100)] = X<br />
P [(1+R/100)<sup>2</sup>] = X+X (1+R/100)<br />
Divide both sides by (1+r/100)<sup>2</sup><br />
So we left with<br />
<strong>P= X/(1+r/100)<sup>2</sup> + X/(1+r/100)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Generalizing the formula for EQUAL INSTALLMENTS </strong><br />
<strong>P= X/(1+r/100)<sup>n</sup> + X/(1+r/100)</strong><br />
Where x is the installment and n is number of installment</p>
<p><strong>Example 2: </strong><br />
<strong>Richa borrowed a sum of Rs. 4800 from Ankita as a loan . She promised Ankita that she will pay it back in two equal installments .If the rate of Interest be 5% per annum compounded annually, find the amount of each installment</strong><br />
<strong>Solution:</strong><br />
Given that principal value = 4800<br />
Rate =5%<br />
Two equal installments annually = 2 years<br />
Appling the formula = X/(1+r/100)<sup>n</sup>…………………….X/(1+r/100)<br />
So we have here two equal installments so<br />
P= X/(1+r/100)<sup>2</sup> + X/(1+r/100)<br />
4800=X/(1+5/100)<sup>2</sup> + X/(1+5/100)<br />
On simplifying<br />
We have x= Rs. 2581.46<br />
So the amount of each installment is 2581.46</p>
<p><strong>Application of Compound Interest for concepts of population growth. </strong><br />
<br /><strong>Case 1: When population growing in a constant rate</strong><br />
If the rate growth of population increased with a constant, rate then the population after T years will be = P (1+R/100)<sup>t</sup></p>
<p>In fact, this is nothing else but an application of the fundamentals of compound interest.<br />
It is actually similar to finding the compound amount after time T years<br />
Net population after T years = = P (1+R/100)<sup>t</sup><br />
Net population increase = P [(1+R/100)<sup>t</sup>– 1]</p>
<p><strong>Example 3:</strong><br />
<strong>The population of Chandigarh is increasing at a rate of 4% per annum. The population of Chandigarh is 450000, find the population in 3 years hence.</strong><br />
Solution:<br />
P = 450000<br />
Rate of increasing = 4%<br />
Time =3 years<br />
Therefore, the total population will be<br />
=&gt; T = P (1+R/100)<sup>3</sup><br />
=&gt; T = 450000(1+4/100)<sup>3</sup><br />
=&gt; T = 506188</p>
<p><strong>Case 2: When the population growing with different rates and for different intervals of time </strong><br />
If the rate growth of population increased with different, rate and for different intervals of time then the population after T years will be =<br />
P (1+R1/100)<sup>t1 </sup>x  (1+R2/100)<sup>t2</sup> x ... x (1+RN/100)<sup>tn</sup></p>
<p>Let us take an example for this concept.<br />
<strong>Example 4:</strong><br />
<strong>The population of Chandigarh increased at a rate of 1% for first year, the rate for second year is 2%, and for third year, it is 3%. Then what will be the population after 3 years if present population of Chandigarh is 45000?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
Since the rate growth of population increased with different rates for the three difference years, the population after T years will be =<br />
P (1+R1/100)<sup>t1 </sup>x  (1+R2/100)<sup>t </sup>x (1+R/100)<sup>tn</sup><br />
45000(1+1/100)<sup>1</sup> x (1+2/100)<sup>1</sup> x (1+3/100)<sup>1</sup>=47749.77</p>
<p><strong>Case 3: When the population is decreasing with rate R</strong><br />
Population after a time period of T years=P (1-R/100)<sup>t</sup><br />
Where T is the total population<br />
R is rate at which the population is decreasing</p>
<p><strong>Example 5:</strong><br />
The population of Chandigarh is increases at a rate of 1% for first year, it decreases at the rate of 2% for the second year and for third year it again increases at the rate of 3%. Then what will be the population after 3 years if present population of Chandigarh is 45000.</p>
<p>Solution:<br />
Since the rate growth of population is increasing first and then decreasing for the second year and again it increases for third year, then the population after T years will be =<br />
Present Population: P (1+1/100)<sup>t1 </sup>x  (1-2/100)<sup>t </sup>x (1+3/100)<sup>t3</sup><br />
Present Population:  45000(1+1/100)<sup>1</sup> x (1-2/100)<sup>1</sup> x (1+3/100)<sup>1</sup>=45877.23</p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>Negative Compound Interest</strong><br />
It is not necessary that there is always an increase in any quantity or amount. There can also be a reduction in the amount of something. 
This rate of this reduction is called the rate of depreciation. In this case we take the interest rate to be negative.</p>
<p>Let P be the original amount.<br />
Let P1 be the new amount at the end of t years.<br />
P1 = P (1-R/100)<sup>t</sup><br />
Here R is the rate of interest (negative rate).<br />
Always remember, the rate of depreciation is nothing else but negative rate of interest.</p>
<p><strong>Example 6:</strong><br />
<strong>Manpreet bought a new car. The value of the car is Rs. 45000. If rate of depreciation is 10% per annum then what will be the value of the car after 2 years </strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
P = 45000<br />
Rate of depreciation = 10%<br />
T = 2 years<br />
Therefore, the value will be after 2 years<br />
= P (1 &#8211; R/100)<sup>t</sup><br />
= 45000(1-10/100)<sup>2</sup><br />
= 36450</p>
