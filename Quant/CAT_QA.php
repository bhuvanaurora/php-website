                     <p> The Quantitative Aptitude section comprises of fundamental mathematics, based on 10 + 2 difficulty level. The QA Questions featured in the CAT are mostly are mostly application oriented and test one’s grasp of fundamentals. So what one really should do is to get all the fundamentals straight and it would be an easy cakewalk thereafter.

                <h3 id="section2"> SYLLABUS</h3>
                    <p> The Quant syllabus for CAT can be categorised into 5 main categories:-</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li> <strong> ALGEBRA </strong></li>
                                <p> Algebra itself comprises of multiple sections which are equally important and a serious aspirant should get his hand into practising all of them. </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Inequalities</li>
                                    <li> Equations </li>
                                    <li> Functions </li> 
                                    <li> Progressions </li>
                                    <li> Logarithms & Exponents </li>
                                </ul> </br>

                            <li> <strong> NUMBER SYSTEMS </strong>  </li>
                                <p> Number System problems are usually very simple but at times they become quite typical if approached wrongly. They require certain tricks that you can pick up from any good textbook. Number Base System also deserves the mention here. This contributes 3-4 questions to every CAT, and so it is a very important topic. You should be comfortable writing numbers in their algebraic form. You should also learn about divisibility tests and the other points that will the handling of numbers pretty easy. </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Numbers </li>
                                    <li> Factors and Multiples </li> 
                                    <li> HCF-LCM </li>
                                    <li> Divisibiity </li>
                                    <li> Remainders </li>
                                    <li> Factorials</li>
                                </ul> </br>

                            <li> <strong> GEOMETRY </strong> </li>
                                <p> These are diagram based hence they are combined together. Maximum weightage is given to geometry among the three of them, although every CAT paper will have 3-4 questions on mensuration, as well as a couple of questions on coordinate geometry. Topics that need to be covered in geometry are basic theorems involving triangles, circles, parallel lines and other shapes. Similarity and Congruency of triangles is an important property to look after for as they shape the pattern and type of the questions. </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Triangles</li> 
                                    <li> Quadrilaterals</li>
                                    <li> Polygons </li>
                                    <li> Coordinate Geomtery </li>
                                    <li> Mensuration </li>
                                    <li> Trigonometry</li>
                                </ul> </br>

                            <li> <strong> COMBINATORICS </strong> </li>
                                <p> The topics include:-</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Permutations & Combinations</li> 
                                    <li> Probability</li>
                                    <li> Binomial Theorem </li>
                                    <li> Set Theory </li>
                                </ul>   </br>

                            <li> <strong> ARITHMETIC </strong> </li>
                                <p> Arithmetic is usually vast but it compose a lesser part and only a few topics make it to the final but since one can never be sure, hence you should have the insight in all the topics. All these topics are covered as part of the school syllabus, but may need some brushing up on as the difficulty somewhat increases.</p>
